```

An API (Application Programming Interface) is an intermediary between a large dataset and the applications at user end. It provides an accessible way to request data from a dataset by URL.

There are several methods to communicate with API server, including `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD` and `OPTIONS`[^1]. Here we will focus on GET requests which is the most common and widely used methods in APIs.

In R, the {`httr`} package is used to access API using URL.

## `GET` data

The steps to convert retrieved API data to standard R object, include

1.  determine request URL. Usually this is database specific. It requires to read database API page
2.  construct GET URL using `paste` or `glue` string conjugation functions in R
3.  exact raw type data and convert raw to character `rawToChar(raw_data$content)`
4.  convert character to R objects. Depends on character format, the usual format include table (aka, separator are \t and \n) or [json](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). If it is json, using `jsonlite::fromJSON` to convert to `list`. If it is table, use `read.table(text = char_data)` to convert to `data.frame`.

Here I used protein interaction database (STRING) as example to access API. The methods for STRING API can be found at [STING help page](https://string-db.org/help/api/).

```{r}
library(httr)
string_url <- 'https://string-db.org'

genelist <- c("PRMT5", "PRMT1", "MTAP")
        
raw_data <- GET(
        paste0(
                string_url,
                '/api/tsv/ppi_enrichment?identifiers=',
                paste(genelist, collapse = "%0d"),
                "&species=9606"
        ) # create complete url
)
```

`raw` class data is like

```{r echo=F}
raw_data$content
```

Convert raw data to R object `data.frame`

```{r}
char_data <- rawToChar(raw_data$content) # using raw_data$content exact raw type data and convert raw to character

char_data

if (!grepl("Error|error", char_data)) { # to filter error out
        read.table(text = char_data, header = T)  # convert raw data into data.frame
}
```

For the json example, refer to Joachim Schork's blog post on time series COVID data [^2].

## common issues

### unable to get local issuer certificate

> Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = handle) : SSL peer certificate or SSH remote key was not OK: \[string-db.org\] SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate.

It is due to no libcurl or right version of libcurl in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. By default, LD should point to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` then `/usr/lib:/usr/lib64`. Try `ldconfig -v | grep libcurl` or `ls /usr/lib64/libcurl*` in terminal, it points whether libcurl is available in your OS. If no found, install by `sudo yum install libcurl-devel` in RedHat7

In my case, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` point to conda lib `/home/csu03/miniconda3/lib` which is based on Python 3.9, while OS system default Python 2.7. I solved the above issue by `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/usr/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` before enter R.[^3]

In the above reference, it also solve the `yum update` error like below

### Peer's Certificate issuer is not recognized.

> Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = handle) : Peer certificate cannot be authenticated with given CA certificates: \[string-db.org\] Peer's Certificate issuer is not recognized.

It could be firewall and proxy issue. Based on this post[^4], adding following in R code

[^4]: https://www.r-bloggers.com/2016/09/fixing-peer-certificate-cannot-be-authenticated/

```{r eval=F}
set_config(config(ssl_verifypeer = 0L))
```
