As an amateur investor, I have been always questioning my investing strategies, and wondering how different strategies result in the gains. Retrospect analysis is a good way to answer the question partially.\n\nIn this TidyTuesday[^2] exercise, I will use strategy of \"buy low sell high\" at 52 weeks cycle on these big tech stocks, and see which company fits this strategy the best.\n\n[^2]: Thomas Mock (2022).

However, there are till many interesting ideas to explore.\n\n1.  If we adjust parameters in the \"buy-low-sell-high\" strategy, eg: `start_date`, `period`, `cash_limit`, `num_per_buy` and `cash_per_buy`, will it make gain-risk-ratio change dramatically within the same stock? Just like I tune hyper-parameters in ML exercise!\n\n2.  The current model did not take taxes (which is a big expense in trading) into consideration. How long to hold a stock determines tax brackets. It will improve the estimate accuracy of true gain.\n\n3.  All the price of big tech stocks were slowly climbing up at early time. Will my functions break if the stock kept dropping?\n\n4.  All the price of big tech stocks are quite stable. Will a more fluctuated stock make difference on the \"buy-low-sell-high\" strategy?\n\n5.  I did not use this strategy in my personal trading. Instead, I just invest fixed amount of cash into index fund recurrently with a certain frequency. How about writing the \"recurrent invest\" strategy and comparing this to \"buy-low-sell-high\" strategy?\n\nAt R-ladies Philly event, Alice mentioned a R package `{quantmod}` to download daily price for any stocks and perform quantitative financial modeling. I may want to try it out sometime.\n\nBesides the stock context itself, I have a few final take-away from this exercise:\n\n1.  When question is complicated, I should modularize the question and solve the big question by accomplishing little steps first.\n\n-   Modular programming is one-step towards object-oriented programming, although there are difference between modular programming and object-oriented programming [^1].\n\n-   I had to spend an extra night to clean up the code to make everything function-based (object-oriented?). However, just like writing paper, spitting it out is always the hardest but also the very first step. Do not worry about the coding style at beginning, just spit it out!\n\n[^1]: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18034683/what-is-the-big-difference-between-modular-and-object-oriented-programming#:\\~:text=Modular%20programming%20(also%20called%20%22top,aspect%20of%20the%20desired%20functionality.\">What is the big difference between modular and object oriented programming?</a>\n\n2.  As usually, I picked up several tricks to \"filter\" the rows.\n\n-   using `filter(cumsum(<boolean>) ...)`\n\n    -   `filter(cumsum(is_wk52_low) > 0)`: remove the first x rows where `is_wk52_low` is `FALSE` (but not removing anything after is_wk52_low being `TRUE` once)\n\n    -   `filter(cumsum(is_wk52_high) == 1)`: remove everything after `is_wk52_high` is `TRUE` for the first time\n\n    -   `filter(cumsum(stock_cash_cumsum >= 0) == row_number())`: remove everything after `stock_cash_cumsum >= 0` is `FALSE` for the first time (note: different from simple `filter(stock_cash_cumsum >=0)` by even removing `stock_cash_cumsum >=0` cases after first `FALSE` case)\n\n-   using `slice()`\n\n    -   `slice(n())`: just keep last row\n\n    -   `slice(1:max(which(stock_num < 0)))`: keep first row until the last row where `stock_num < 0` \n",
