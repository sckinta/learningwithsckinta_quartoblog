# Chun Su

👋 Hi! Thank you for stopping by! I am a computational biologist working in the field of omics. Although trained as a bench scientist, I gradually developed a passion for programming by taking online courses and attending local meetups, such as [R-Ladies Philly](https://www.rladiesphilly.org/). I love exploring new ideas and firmly believe that learning is a lifelong journey. This personal website is my space to share study notes, projects, and insights from my learning adventures. My hope is that these resources inspire and support other self-learners along their own journeys.
