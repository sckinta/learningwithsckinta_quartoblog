# Chun Su

Hi! Thank you for stopping by! I am a computational biologist, and volunteer as a co-organizer at [Rladies Philly](https://www.rladiesphilly.org/). Originally from China, I came to the U.S. in 2011 and completed my PhD in Biology at the University of Virginia in 2017. Starting as a Perl programmer, I picked up R and Python by taking online courses and attending local meetup workshops. I enjoy learning new programming skills and believe learning is a life-time mission. I would like to dedicate this personal website to sharing the study notes and projects in my learning journey. Hopefully it will help or motivate other self-learners.
